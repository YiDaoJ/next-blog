It's been almost a month since my last journal entry. I was so busy with project work and training pre-work that I didn't have time for English practice or side projects after work, or any input for that matter. I know it sounds like an excuse, but that's the truth. Anyway, now that it's finally over.

Recently, I caught a cold and my cat Gengbal had an upset stomach. I visited the office only once in the last two months and got infected by my colleague. ðŸ˜‚ Since I've had Gengbao, she's never had such serious diarrhea. Unfortunately, during her recovery, we both got worse. I'm not complaining, just writing about it in English. Life constantly reminds me of the reality of being single. However, I still don't intend to find a partner just to share this kind of burden.

Tomorrow, I will moderate the daily stand-up for the first time. Honestly, I'm quite nervous since I'm not good at active listening. (I always say I'm a good listener, but that's paradoxical. ðŸ˜‚) I have to do it anyway. As Young Sheldon said, "It's okay to be scared, we just have to do it anyway." The new job is challenging, and sometimes I feel less capable than I'd like. But I still enjoy it because I'm stepping out of my comfort zone.
