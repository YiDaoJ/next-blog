This is the first test post of my blog.

The posts of my blog will be written in [markdown](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
At the very beginning I planned to create and save my post via CMS, which is more complex than loading MD file from the app itself and rendering it.

I tought it would be helpful to me to try this way, in which I can understand the data-fetching, pre-rendering well and faster. Btw, I can deploy this blog website to vercel, it is also very convinient.

I've no idea what I should write in my blog, perhaps my weekly journal of learning English.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to it.
