This week I started another English lesson with Denise, an English teacher from Cameroon who I met through the language learning App [Preply](https://preply.com/).
From her profile video, I could tell that she has an outgoing charater, which impressed me and motivated me to learn from her.
Our trial session proved me right. She encouraged me to talk more and shared her own funny experiences.
I've booked two sessions a week with her, and am looking forward to talking with her next Friday!

I find another effient(? effective) way to pratise my communication skills: going to the office. ðŸ˜‚
This week I had lunch with J and found out that he has two cats. This was an excellent topic for discussion!
And I got to see a different side of him when he talked about his childhood trauma regarding his first cat.
I felt sorry for him, and at the same time I was somehow "glad(?)" that my collegue was showing me his real emotions outside of work.
