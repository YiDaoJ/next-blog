I recently watched the Amazon Prime Video documentary series [Clarkson's Farm](https://www.amazon.de/Clarksons-Farm-Staffel-1/dp/B095R6JQQ1) and loved the way the presenter talked, joked, and complained. It made me want to express myself more freely using my poor humor with people, both in English and German.

I'm finally eligible to take my driving exam, but... yes there is always a but waiting for us. Unfortunately, the number of examinees allowed from the examing institution is very limited, which mean I have to wait a long time. Frustrating! ü§∑ Recently I've been practicing driving downtown and have found that it's more difficult than driving on the highway. The lanes are sometimes unclear, and I have to concentrate intensely and make decisions within half a second, which is not my strong suit.

My boss has told me that I need to improve my oral communication sillks significantly, which reminded me of the phrase "hervorragende Verbesserung" that my SQL professor used when talkiing to me about my German language skills. So, I found an App, through which I can talk with native speakers. I'll give it a try, hopefully it will help.
