About 3 months ago, the leader of our development group suggested that we could play around with the package manager [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and builder such as [turbo](https://turbo.build/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

Since I have never created a monorepo on my own, an idea came up in my head: How about setting up a monorepo with pnpm and using vite to build a sub-package of it.

My plan is to create a monorepo with three sub-packages: Server, Client, Components.

- Server: a mock server built with [stubr](https://github.com/stubrjs/stubr) that will handle the API request.
- Client: working as a web application interface built with React.js, which is able to communicate with the server; initiated with Vite.
- Components: contains only atom components that can be called in the client.

Let's see what the difference is between a yarn workspace and a pnpm workspace!
